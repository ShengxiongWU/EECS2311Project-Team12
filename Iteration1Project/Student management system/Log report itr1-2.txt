Rationale behind changes on plan and big design decisions
The only change in iteration 0 is we added the user interface for our application. This is not included in the original plan of our iteration. Using Java Swing, we created a user interface for the registration and login processes. We chose to do user interface because we don't have much experience with it, and if we begin creating the UI in Iteration 2, that could have a significant impact on our project. We also do not  want to leave the UI in Iteration 3 because we need to present our choice to the customer and demonstrate why we decided to finish the UI in the first Phase.
 
Any concern with the project or group members
No concerns with the group members. Not having any major concerns with the project, we did have technical issues with editing but managed to get it resolved while communicating with the team.

The development tasks per user story for iteration 0: 
CourseList - This user story's development task is to construct classes and functions.
Check course prerequisites- The algorithm that will check the input course and inform the user of the prerequisites for that specific course will be the development task for this.
Academic Record Database: The development job for this section is to create a database table and add all of the student academic records to it. Also, the courses that the student completes and does not complete .This table covers the following information: First Name, Last Name, Course, Grades, and Prerequisites.
Personal Information Database: The development job for this section is to create a database table and add all of the user personal information to it. This table contains the following information: First Name, Last Name, Contact Number, Address, Student ID, and Login ID.
